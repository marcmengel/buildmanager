<H3 CLASS=ABSTRACT>Abstract:</H3>
<P CLASS=ABSTRACT>Previous work on build systems at Fermilab has led to the conclusion
that a better tool to help manage builds on multiple platforms will
greatly boost productivity in getting products released on multiple
platforms.
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00010000000000000000">Overview</A></H1>
Many users when faced with the task of building software on multiple
platforms simply use a multiple window display, log onto each system,
and switch windows, starting builds in each one. The process is somewhat
error prone however, due to the problem of remembering what has been
done on each platform, and not all of the screens fitting on the display
at once. Two products have been used to attempt to address these issues;
<EM>uas_build </EM>and <EM>happi</EM>. While both have benefits and
drawbacks, the author believes a tool is possible which has the benefits
of both and a few features that they both lack.
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">Benifits of previous implementations</A></H1>
The approach that <EM>happi</EM><A NAME="tex2html1" HREF="#87"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/conv2html/LaTeX2HTML_icons/foot_motif.gif"></A> takes somewhat solves the tracking problem by putting all of the
builds into a state machine, which ensures that we know how far along
each build has gotten; <EM>happi </EM>also provides a user interface
showing the output from multiple builds proceeding in parallel simultaneously
on the screen, which is an improvement over multiple X terminals,
etc. The approach taken by the <EM>uas_build </EM>package was to automatically
launch make commands in parallel on multiple platforms, and display
the output in xterm windows, one per host. This allowed flexibility
to launch arbitrary commands in arbitrary order on the various build
systems in the process of building the software.
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">Limitiations of previous implementations</A></H1>
Both of these solutions (<EM>happi </EM>and <EM>uas_build</EM>)are
somewhat limited, in that the user cannot interact with the sessions
on the build machines, rather they are confined to pre-defined actions
in the build system, often forcing a user to have a separate login
session on the build systems to see what's really going on, which
generally leads to the user running partial builds that the build
system is unaware of, and then having to re-do them through the build
system if the build system is to keep track of the progress. <EM>happi
</EM>enforces a very coarse-grained state machine, where recovering
from any errors in the build process involves starting the whole build
over from scratch.
<P>
A second issue is the complexity of the build system; <EM>happi </EM>is
a multiple-layered system, with each layer written in a different
scripting language. <EM>uas_build </EM>uses a makefile-template system
which was intended to free the user from having to know the details
of Makefiles, but which led to more confusion due to synchonization
issues between the config file and the Makefiles built from it.
<P>
Both systems in their original form use symbolic link ``forests'' to
provide the illusion of multiple copies of the sources, in an attempt
to cut down on copies and divergence between copies. This implementation
leads to subtle problems if symbolic links get added for non-source
files, etc. Since the lab as a whole is moving towards CVS as a version
control system, this seems a much better choice for maintaining mulitple
source trees for multiple builds.
<P>
Another problem with the previous build systems has been with authentication
issues; if a build needs to be done on a system separate from the
usual build cluster environment (for things like Oracle licenses,
use of node-locked software checking tools, etc), running commands
on that system can be difficult, or if the user needs access to mixed
AFS non-AFS systems, using rsh often doesn't get the user authenticated.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">Proposed solution</A></H1>
<P>
I propose we use a simple framework to manage this problem which combines
the nice user interface of <EM>happi </EM>with even more flexibility
than <EM>uas_build</EM>. We can use the <EM>expect </EM>package to
manage multiple telnet sessions for us. We have existing <EM>expect
</EM>scripts which handle logging into various sorts of systems, and
others which interconnect Tk text windows with an <EM>expect </EM>session.
This makes it possible to build a simple screen interface which logs
onto multiple systems, and presents each system's login session with
a text window, where typing in that window works like a regular terminal
session and sends characters to the remote system.
<P>
Buttons can be added to this system which send specific canned commands
to all or some of the sessions thus connected, and if this is done
with appropriate system specific substitutions, various operations
can be launched on those systems that will proceed in parallel. The
interaction script can also be taught to look for particular keyword
or pattern based strings coming back from the build session and do
things like highlight text and note success or failure of given actions.
We could add standard messages to our new Makefile templates to facilitate
this understanding.
<P>
At this point, by integrating existing code fragments, we can (as
before) perform specific canned actions on a list of build machines,
and keep track of their success/failure. But we can also click on
one of the windows and interact directly with the session, and successful
completion of various tasks will still be noted, since the same watcher
that notes the completion of automated tasks will see success messages
when they result from user interaction.
<P>
Platform specific initialization can be included in the login portion
of the package, simply by checking the platform type when we log in
and performing the appropriate actions.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">Milestones</A></H1>
<P>
I propose the project be built in several stages, each of which will
be useful in itself, with each stage building on the previous ones.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00051000000000000000">Initial prototype</A></H2>
<P>
The initial prototype would simply be capable of logging into multiple
systems, presenting the interaction windows for each system, and letting
the user enter commands that will execute on all systems simultaneously.
It is estimated that this will be 10..20 hours of effort.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00052000000000000000">Platform-specifics</A></H2>
<P>
A second version would add platform specific initialization (which
would combine information already recorded in <EM>uas_build </EM>and
<EM>happi </EM>about command search paths, etc.) to the system, and
flavor replacement in the command execution. That means you could
tell the tool to issue a command like:
<P>
<TT>setup -f %F product vx_y</TT><BR><BR>
<P>
and the appropriate flavor string would be automatically substituted
on each platform. This allows testing of command sequences that will
be made into canned actions in the next phase. This should be 5..10
hours of work.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00053000000000000000">Standard Actions</A></H2>
<P>
Next, various standard actions could be added as buttons or pull-down
menus, etc. that would put the standard make targets in our makefiles
(and other common actions), as canned sequences attached to buttons.
Generating and testing a short list of these would take only a few
hours, but this is an activity that will probably continue throughout
the life of the product as choices of what is ``standard'' are extended.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00054000000000000000">Status Recognition</A></H2>
<P>
Code could and probably should be added to the event loop dealing
with text returning from the remote systems to recognize:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> command completion (indicated by printing a standardized prompt)
<LI> status messages printed by the standard actions from the previous
section, or printed by the makefile templates on completion of various
tasks
<LI> various error message formats, so that error messages could be highlighted
in red, for example.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
This would allow the addition of a status icon next to each system
interaction window which would indicate the state of the activity
on the given system. Then a user could see at a glance that a command
was still running, or that the command failed, etc. This is another
area that could be incrementally improved through the life of the
product, after an initial few hours of work to get underway. A status
icon indicating part 1, above, should probably be added to a very
early version as a proof of concept, and other bits and pieces could
be added as needed.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">State information</A></H1>
<P>
The build system should be able to determine, for a given product
on a given system, whether the product has been checked out of CVS
into its build area, whether a local instance of the product has been
declared to the appropriate UPS database, if the software has passed
its regression tests (this should be determined by as standardized
stamp file in the product build makefile templates) and if the product
has been distributed.
<P>
It should eventually have standard actions to attempt to step through
these stages, but to let the user intervene if a stage fails. If the
user intervention succeeds, then the automatic process can pick back
up where the user left off.
<P>
<H1><A NAME="SECTION00070000000000000000">Configuration</A></H1>
<P>
The build system should be configurable on a per-system, per-group,
and per-user basis. Lists of systems upon which to build, system types,
etc. should be obtained from one of several sources so that groups
can share pertinent configuration information, but override it when
needed. Information that the system needs to maintain includes:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> List of platforms and corresponding nodes upon which to build
<LI> Location of build directories on those nodes (parameterized by product,
flavor, &amp; version)
<LI> Special login information (e.g. on host fred you need to log on, then
run ``klog'' as well)
<LI> UPS database to use for development product declarations
<LI> Distribution mechanism (e.g. put into kits with addproduct, installed
as a local product, etc.)
<P>
</UL>
<P>
This information should be looked for:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> In the user's home directory
<LI> In the product area in a file specific to their primary group-id
<LI> In the product area in a file specific to the current system
<LI> In a general product config file.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
That way, sites using the build system in the ``standard'' way will
have very little to override, but individual users can tailor the
behavior of the build for their own purposes (for example to have
their builds use a file tree under their home directory rather than
one in a system-wide location). As the product matures, these pieces
of data should be configurable from within the system.
