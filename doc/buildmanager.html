<h1>Buildmanager Documentation</h1>

This is the buildmanager front end, which helps you to keep track of
builds running on multiple platforms simultaneously.

There are several documents available:
<ul>
<li><a href="Integrating.html">Integrating buildmanager, cvs template_product, and upd</a>  describes how we envision the tool being used.
<li><a href="Using.html">Using buldmanager</a>  describes the tool,
    how to start it, and use generic features of the product.
<li><a href="Design.html">A Design for a MultiPlatform Build Manager</a> 
    discusses the original plan for buildmanager, and may provide added
    insight into how it works for users and administrators.
<li><a href="Local.html">Local Customizations</a> describes any local
    command menu items which have been added to the local buildmanager
    configuration.
<li><a href="Configuring.html">Configuring buildmanager</a> describes how
    to design and add command menu items to the local configuration, and
    how to set up local configurations.
</ul>
