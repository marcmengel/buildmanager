    <h1>
      Configuring buildmanager
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Config files read by buildmanager
    </h2>
    There are several configuration files for buildmanager that
    users or system managers may want to configure, and the
    configuration can be done in one of three places to affect any
    indivdual user: 
    <ul>
      <li>
        The system-wide ${BUILDCONFIG_DIR}/lib/system.cfg
      </li>
      <li>
        The cluster-wide ${BUILDCONFIG_DIR}/lib/
        <i>
          domainname
        </i>
        .cfg
      </li>
      <li>
        The users ${HOME}/.buildmanagerrc
      </li>
    </ul>
    These files are searched for in this order, and are sourced
    into the buildmanager program, which is an 
    <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/expect">
      expect
    </a>
    script, which means they are written in 
    <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/tcl">
      Tcl
    </a>
    -- the Tool Command Language. Variables and procedures which
    are commonly defined in these files are examined in the
    following sections. 
    <br />
    <h2>
      Making simple changes in your .buildmanagerrc
    </h2>
    If you just want to turn on/off a particular host, do: 
<pre>
  set host_dat(do,bldlinux61)   1
  set host_dat(do,bldosf1v40d)  0
</pre>
    in your ~/.buildmanagerrc, and leave the rest alone. If you
    want to just add one alternate host do: 
<pre>
  set host_dat(LIST) "$host_dat(LIST) myhost"
  set host_dat(h2f,myhost)   IRIX+5
  set host_dat(do,myhost)    1
</pre>
    to change product roots, add a definition for proc
    "productroot" to your .buildmanagerrc as described in the next
    section. 
    <h2>
      Defining the product root
    </h2>
    buildmanager believes it knows where the working copy of a
    given product for a given flavor is supposed to be. It
    determines this by calling the Tcl subroutine 
    <b>
      productroot
    </b>
    with an argument of the flavor (or flavor and -q qualifiers).
    This subroutine should return a string giving the pathname to
    the directory involved. For example, consider the following
    definition in your domainname.cfg file: 
    <br />
    <hr width="100%" />
<pre>
proc productroot { flavor } {
    global product version env

    if { "$flavor" == "Linux+2" } {
        return "/scratch/${product}-${version}-${flavor}"
    }
    return "/usr/products/build-scratch/${product}-${version}-${flavor}"
}
</pre>
    <hr width="100%" />
    This puts the working copy under /scratch for Linux systems,
    and under /usr/products/build-scratch otherwise. Note the use
    of the global variables 
    <b> product </b>, <b>version</b>, and <b>env</b>
    , which are the product name from the main buildmanager window,
    the version string from the main buildmanager window, and the
    UNIX environment hashed array, respectively. 
    <br />
    <h2>
      Defining the list of hosts
    </h2>
    The list of hosts buildmanager uses at startup is defined
    somewhat in pieces in the config file, 
    <br />
    all by setting entries in the 
    <b>
      host_dat
    </b>
    hashed array. For each host you want to have buildmanager know
    about at startup, the following items are needed: 
    <ul>
      <li>
        The host name should appear in the list value of 
        <b>
          host_dat(LIST)
        </b>
      </li>
      <li>
        1 or 0 should be the value of 
        <b>
          host_dat(do,
          <i>
            hostname
          </i>
          )
        </b>
        , which says if the host should initially have its entry
        checked on or off.
      </li>
      <li>
        The host's flavor should be the value of 
        <b>
          host_dat(h2f,
          <i>
            hostname
          </i>
          ),
        </b>
        which defines what Operating System string will be
        associated with that host
      </li>
    </ul>
    So, an example with two hosts, one flavor Linux+2, one flavor
    IRIX+5 would be: 
    <br />
    <hr width="100%" />
<pre>
set host_dat(LIST) {linuxhost irixhost}
</pre>
<pre>
set host_dat(do,linuxhost) 1
set host_dat(do,irixhost)  1
</pre>
<pre>
set host_dat(h2f,linuxhost) Linux+2
set host_dat(h2f,irixhost)  IRIX+5
</pre>
    <hr width="100%" />
    <h2>
      Defining O.S. specific startup commands
    </h2>
    The hash os_dat contains various information associated with
    each O.S. string 
    <i>
      flavor
    </i>
    defined in host_dat. In particular, it includes 
    <b>
      os_dat(PLAT_COMMANDS,
      <i>
        flavor
      </i>
      )
    </b>
    , which are commands to run upon logging into machines of O.S.
    string 
    <i>
      flavor
    </i>
    . Also, 
    <b>
      os_dat(PATH,
      <i>
        flavor
      </i>
      )
    </b>
    contains the initial value for the PATH environment variable
    that buildmanager will set upon logging into the system. There
    should also be an operating system list in os_dat(LIST).
    Setting these values looks like: 
    <hr width="100%" />
<pre>
set os_dat(LIST)  {IRIX+5 Linux+2 SunOS+5}
</pre>
<pre>
set os_dat(PATH,Linux+2) "/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin"
set os_dat(PATH,IRIX+5)  "/usr/X11/bin:/usr/bsd:/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/local/bin"
</pre>
<pre>
lappend os_dat(PLAT_COMMANDS,SunOS+5)     {setenv OPENWINHOME "/usr/openwin"}
set os_dat(PATH,SunOS+5) "/opt/SUNWspro/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/ucb:/usr/openwin/bin:/usr/local/bin"
</pre>
    <hr width="100%" />
    <h2>
      Changing the Commands menu
    </h2>
    The commands menu is built from the array cmd_menu, which is a
    hashed array mapping from strings which will appear in the menu
    to internal buildmanager Tcl commands. It is reccomended you
    always include at least the following ones to be compatable
    with the buildmanager documentation: 
    <hr width="100%" />
<pre>
array set cmd_menu {
    {cd}                {cmd_parallel  "cd %D"}
    {cvs export}        {cmd_taketurns "cd %d; cvs export -r %V -d %T %P" }
    {cvs checkout}      {cmd_parallel  "cd %d; cvs co -r %V -d %T -A %P" }
    {make build_n_test} {cmd_parallel "(cd %D; make build_n_test)"}
    {setup -q build?}   {cmd_parallel  "cd %D; setup -q 'build?' -r `pwd` -M ./ups -m %P.table %P"}
    {setup}             {cmd_parallel  "cd %D; setup  -r `pwd` -M ./ups -m %P.table %P"}
    {make declare}      {cmd_taketurns "(cd %D; make declare)"}
    {make all}          {cmd_parallel  "(cd %D; make all)"}
    {make test}         {cmd_parallel  "(cd %D; make test)"}
    {make clean}        {cmd_parallel  "(cd %D; make clean)"}
    {make kits}         {cmd_taketurns "(cd %D; make kits)"}
    {make local}        {cmd_taketurns "(cd %D; make local)"}
    {remove source}     {cmd_parallel  "cd %d; rm -rf %T"}
    {cvs update}        {cmd_parallel "(cd %D; cvs update -d)"}
    {cvs update -A}     {cmd_parallel "(cd %D; cvs update -A)"}
    {clear auto}        {clear_statepending}
    {interrupt}         {cmd_parallel  "\x003"}
    {exit}              {cmd_parallel  "exit"; after 5000 exit}
}
</pre>
    <hr width="100%" />
    Note that the menu is generated by sorting the hash keys
    (otherwise they come out in no particular order) 
    <br />
    so you may want to put leading numbers or something to make
    them come out in a given order. 
    <p>
      You can modify these individual commands, or add more, by
      setting individual items in the
      <br />
      cmd_menu array in your config files as well, for example
      <br />
    </p>
<pre>
set cmd_menu(check disk space) {cmd_parallel "df  %D"}
</pre>
    <p>
      <br />
      will add a "check disk space" item to the menu which will run
      "df" on all of the hosts.
    </p>
