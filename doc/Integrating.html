Integrating buildmanager, cvs,&nbsp; template_product, and upd</H1>

<H2>
Abstract</H2>
This document will describe using several tools for building <A HREF="http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/ups/">ups</A>
packages for multiple platforms.&nbsp; While these tools can be used in
isolation, they were designed to be used together to provide the following
benefits:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>
Keeping sources in sync between build areas for multiple platforms</LI>

<LI>
Doing builds for several platforms in parallel</LI>

<LI>
Maintaining revision history and revision control of sources.</LI>

<LI>
Extending the base of products that can be built and tested in a standardized
fashion.</LI>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>
Overview</H2>
We will be describing these tools and how to use them together by way of
building an example product,
<BR><B>demo</B>, and in the process give an introduction to several of
the tools involved.&nbsp; In particular, we will examine the following
in detail:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>
creating a prototype of your product file tree.</LI>

<LI>
placing the file tree in a CVS repository</LI>

<LI>
establishing sessions on multiple build machines</LI>

<LI>
creating a working copy for each session</LI>

<LI>
building and testing your software in parallel</LI>

<LI>
making changes to your file trees</LI>

<LI>
distributing your software via upd</LI>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
If you are logged into one of the nodes on the OSS cluster build machine,
and have the appropriate permissions already, you should be able to go
through the example in this document step by step and build and release
the <B>demo</B> product in order to familiarize yourself with the process.
<H2>
Creating a prototype of your product file tree</H2>
This is really the main role of the <B>template_product</B> package for
most users; getting a
<BR>skeleton of a product together quickly.&nbsp; While the <A HREF="http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/template_product/">web
page</A> for the <B>template_product</B> has
<BR>examples of&nbsp; using it to make products out of scripts or precompiled
binaries, here we will discuss using it to make products out of&nbsp; packages
that are compiled from source code.&nbsp; This generally involves somewhat
more customization than the case where no compilation is required, however
it starts off very much the same way.&nbsp; We begin by:
<UL>
<LI>
setting up <B>template_product</B> to get access to it</LI>

<LI>
making an empty directory and <B>cd</B>-ing there.</LI>

<LI>
using the <B>CloneTemplate</B> script to make the skeleton</LI>

<LI>
adding subdirectories with <B>Makefile</B>s with source code</LI>

<LI>
adding build commands to the toplevel <B>Makefile</B> to build, install,
and test your software</LI>
</UL>
Once this is completed, we will have a prototype product tree that we can
put in a Fermilab <B>cvs</B> repository.

Of course, you will probably want to use&nbsp; your favorite editor rather
than <B>ed</B>, but it is notoriously
<BR>hard to show other editors in use in a document.&nbsp; We now have
a reasonable first approximation of the file tree we want to have under
version control.
<H2>
Putting the file tree into a cvs repository</H2>
Since we will be using <B>cvs</B> to maintain and track our sources, before
doing much else, let us
<BR>go ahead and put this file tree into a repository using <B>cvs import</B>.&nbsp;
If you are not already familiar with <B>cvs</B> you may want to look at
the online <A HREF="http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/cvs/">documentation</A>
, in particular the sections&nbsp; <A HREF="http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/cvs/cvs_2.html#SEC5">What
is CVS?</A>, <A HREF="http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/cvs/cvs_4.html#SEC10">A
sample session</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/cvs/cvs_6.html#SEC23">Starting
a new project</A>.&nbsp; In our case we will be using the second approach
from the
<BR>latter manual section, and importing a whole file tree that we have
just created.
<BR>Before we can do this, however,&nbsp; we must have a CVS repository
into which we can place this source code module for our product.&nbsp;&nbsp;
On most Fermilab development systems, we accomplish this by setting up
a ups
<BR>product like <B>uascvs</B> or <B>cdcvs:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>setup uascvs</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
Actually adding the module is accomplished with a simple command line:
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>cvs import -m "demo product" demo Fermilab <I>username</I>_version</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
which will take the current directory tree and install it into our cvs
repository as version <I><B>username</B>_</I><B>version</B>.
<BR>I reccomend you actually put your username in there, so that several
people following these instructions will check in different versions of
the <B>demo</B> product sources.
<P>If the above command gives you an error like:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Permission denied.
<BR>cvs [import aborted]: end of file from server (consult above messages
if any)</BLOCKQUOTE>
you will need to contact the administrative contact for the repository,
which should be
<BR>the first part of your <B>CVSROOT</B> environment variable -- for example
if your <B>CVSROOT</B>
<BR>is <B>cvsuser@oss-cvs.fnal.gov:/usr/products/olsshare/cvs</B> you would
send mail to
<BR><B>cvsuser@oss-cvs.fnal.gov</B> to get permission to access that repository.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
<B>Establishing sessions on build machines</B></H2>
We can now start working on several machines in parallel, in order to speed
up the process of getting the software built on several machines.&nbsp;
The tool I prefer for his work is a package called <B>buildmanager</B>,
which&nbsp; is an expectk script to run login sessions on multiple machines.&nbsp;&nbsp;
To run it:
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>&lt;build_host> # Setup the product
<BR>&lt;build_host> <B>setup buildmanager</B>
<BR>&lt;build_host> # start buildmanager
<BR>&lt;build_host> <B>buildmanager demo <I>username_</I>version</B>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>This will pop up&nbsp; a login window:
<BR><IMG SRC="loginwin.gif" ALT="partial screen image" >
<BR>and an interaction window:
<BR><IMG SRC="loginwin2.gif" ALT="partial screen image" >
<BR>You can see the list of hosts you will be connecting to, and click
the checkboxes to
<BR>the left of each host to include them or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the
host list is to your liking, enter your
<BR>login name and password in the password window,&nbsp; and hit enter
in the password field,
<BR>or press the Dismiss button to start logging into the various systems.&nbsp;
More details
<BR>on using buildmanager can be found by clicking on the [Help...] button,
or on the
<BR>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/buildmanager">buildmanager
web page</A> .
<H2>
Checking out a copy on each platform</H2>
To get a working copy for each platform build, you can simply pick <B>cvs
checkout</B> from the <B>Commands</B> menu, and buildmanager will change
directories to the designated scratch area on each system and issue the
appropriate commands.&nbsp; You probably&nbsp; then want to select <B>cvs
update -A</B> from the same menu in
<BR>order to clear up the "sticky" tags that checking out a specific revision
creates (see the bottom of&nbsp; <A HREF="http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/cvs/cvs_toc.html#SEC37">this
page</A>&nbsp; in the cvs manual).
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
Doing a test build</H2>
For early stages of development you probably want to do this in several
stages, first setting up
<BR>the product for build by choosing <B>setup -q build</B>, then doing
a compilation by doing a <B>make all</B>,
<BR>and run any provided tests with <B>make test</B>, all of which can
be chosen from the <B>Commands</B> menu.
<H2>
Propagating changes with cvs</H2>
If you make a change in one working copy of the sources, and want to get
the copies all the same, first do a <B>cvs commit -m "some reason"</B>
in the window for the host where the change was made, and then do
<BR>a <B>cvs update</B> in all the windows (either from the entry box at
the top of the buildmanager window, or via the <B>Commands</B> menu.)
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
Distributing your product</H2>
Once your product works to your satisfaction, you can distribute it by
doing a <B>make kits</B> from the
<BR><B>Commands </B>menu, which will take turns running that make command
in each window to add the
<BR>product to a distribution system as defined in the Makefile.
