<h1>Using Buildmanager</h1>

This is the buildmanager front end, which helps you to keep track of
builds running on multiple platforms simultaneously.
Currently the <a href="Design.html">design doc</a> is probably more
informative than this file.

<h2> Starting </h2>
You start by putting a login and password in the Login popup window, 
and then buildmanager will use it them to log into the build machines.

<h2> Adding systems </h2>
You can then add build machines by clicking on their platform buttons
in the main window, or clicking again to delete.

<h2> Removing systems </h2>
You can remove a system by clicking on its platform button to remove it.
You can also close a host window by exiting from the login session.

<h2> Commands </h2>
There are commands in the commands pulldown menu that support most of
the actions you normally want in our new CVS/Build environment
